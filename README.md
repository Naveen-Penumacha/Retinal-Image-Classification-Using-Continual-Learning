# Retinal Image Classification Using Continual Learning

ðŸ“Œ Overview
Retinal image classification is crucial for the early detection and management of various ocular diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and glaucoma. However, traditional machine learning models struggle to adapt to evolving datasets, often requiring complete retraining, which leads to catastrophic forgetting of previously learned information.

To address this, we propose a novel approach that leverages continual learning techniques. Our framework enables continuous integration of new retinal image data while retaining prior knowledge, ensuring consistent and reliable classification performance over time.

ðŸš€ Key Features
âœ… Continual Learning Framework: Prevents catastrophic forgetting by preserving previously acquired knowledge.

âœ… Dynamic Adaptability: Seamlessly incorporates new retinal images without retraining from scratch.

âœ… Improved Diagnostic Accuracy: Achieves higher classification accuracy than conventional methods.

âœ… Extensive Validation: Tested on benchmark retinal image datasets with robust experimental results.
